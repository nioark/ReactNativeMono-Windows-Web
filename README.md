# React Native + Web + Windows Starter

This project is initialized using the official React Native CLI (@react-native-community/cli) and extended to support:

- âœ… Web support using `react-native-web`, `react-dom`, and custom `webpack` configuration
- âœ… Windows support via `react-native-windows`

This allows you to develop and run your app for both web and Windows platforms from a single codebase.
